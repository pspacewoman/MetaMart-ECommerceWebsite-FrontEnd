# 📚 Case Study 

## 📝 How Landing Pages Are Created
- **Objectives**: Capturing leads (like signups and subscriptions), selling a product, or encouraging specific actions (buying a product, downloading an app). 🎯
- **Key Elements**:
  - A **headline** which clearly states what the page is about.
  - **CTA** (Call to Action) buttons to drive user engagement.
  - **Product Details**: Display detailed product information.
  - **Trust Signals** like ratings and reviews to build credibility. ⭐️

## 📍 Why Do Landing Pages Exist?
Landing pages are essential in marketing and web design because they serve a **specific purpose**:
- Unlike homepages that serve many purposes, landing pages focus on one action, such as purchasing a product, checking details of the item, or comparing items. 🛍️
- **Product Introduction**: Landing pages are used to introduce new products and provide detailed information. By having all relevant information in one place, the decision-making process for customers becomes easier. 🤔

## 🌐 How Do Landing Pages Exist?
Landing pages exist as **standalone web pages**, separate from the main website, and are often used in **marketing campaigns**. Here's how they exist:
- **Sub-web pages** on the main website for focused promotions.
- **Independent pages**, like the one I am creating here, called "GitHub Landing Pages". 🌍
